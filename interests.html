    <h1>Personal and Professional Interests</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to the Interests page! I have grouped my interests into personal
      and professional categories. Just like the Home and Projects pages my
      socials and contact info are at the bottom of the page.
    </p>
    <h2>Professional Interests</h2>
    <p>
      Currently I am strongly interested in AI. I have alwayy had an affinity
      for data sets. Finding patterns or trends in data was a part of my prior
      profession that I greatly enjoyed. I am fascinated with the rapid growth
      of AI in recent years, and I would love to be involved in some way. I was
      a geologist prior to CTAC because I love and care for the environment. It
      would be wonderful if I was able to bring that into AI in some way. My
      current hope is that I will be able to leverage my past experience with my
      new knowledge to make sure that AI is being used in ethical and
      environmentally safe ways, and hopefully in ways that will directly help
      the environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also have a strong interest in user facing technology. I find the way
      that people interact with technology and each other fascinating. I try to
      improve my UX/UI work with every project because of how important it is.
      Accessibility is something I would love to learn more about. There are so
      many design philosophies that I haven't even considered, and I would
      really love to get a handle on what is good and accessible design.
    </p>
    <h2>Personal Interests</h2>
    <p>
      I have always had a strong interest in storytelling through text, images,
      film, or other media. I have always been fascinated by the various
      elements of a story. I do not publish any of my ideas in a blog or
      anything, but I do love to discuss and debate about what constitutes a
      good story.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though it may sound strange as an interest, I really enjoy using my brain.
      I really like puzzles or riddles. Finding a problem and then working to
      find a solution is a lot of fun to me, so I frequently do things like
      crosswords, sudoku, or spatial puzzles. I am also always excited to learn
      new things. Even if I'm not planning on becoming an expert on the topic, I
      like knowing enough about it so that I can talk to people about the things
      they find interesting.
